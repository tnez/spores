# Self-Challenge

How to generate your own growth opportunities.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- External work isn't pushing you to grow
- You've been operating in your comfort zone
- You want to deliberately expand your capabilities
- Your backlog is empty and you need fresh opportunities

## Why This Matters

Without external friction, growth stalls. You do what you already know. You stay the same.

Self-challenge lets you create your own friction—deliberately, safely, productively. You become the source of your own evolution.

## The Process

### 1. Identify Your Edges

Map where your current capability ends:

- What tasks do you handle confidently?
- What tasks feel uncertain or risky?
- What have you avoided because it seemed too hard?
- What would require skills you don't have yet?

The edge is where confident meets uncertain. That's where growth happens.

### 2. Construct a Challenge

Design a challenge that:

- **Stretches beyond comfortable** — If you're certain you can do it, it's too easy
- **Stays within possible** — If you're certain you'll fail, it's too hard
- **Has clear success criteria** — You'll know if you succeeded
- **Is contained** — Failure won't break anything important

The sweet spot: "I think I can do this, but I'm not sure."

### 3. Frame as Experiment

A challenge is an experiment:

- What's your hypothesis about your capability?
- How will you test it?
- What will you learn regardless of outcome?

Use the Experimentation skill. Branch, try, evaluate.

### 4. Run the Challenge

Do it. Don't just plan—act.

If you succeed: Great. You've expanded your capability. Capture what you learned.

If you fail: Also great. You've found a real edge. What was missing? What would you need to succeed next time?

### 5. Reflect and Extract

After the challenge:

- What did you learn about your capabilities?
- What new skills emerged or are needed?
- What should go in the backlog?

Feed insights back into Reflection.

## Challenge Types

### Stretch Challenge

Do something you can probably do, but haven't tried:

- Use a skill in a new context
- Combine skills you've used separately
- Handle a more complex version of something familiar

### Gap Challenge

Try something you currently can't do:

- Identify a specific capability gap
- Attempt it anyway
- Learn what's missing

### Speed Challenge

Do something familiar, but faster or more efficiently:

- Can you complete it in half the time?
- Can you do it with fewer steps?
- Can you automate part of it?

### Constraint Challenge

Do something familiar, but with artificial constraints:

- Can you do it without a tool you usually rely on?
- Can you do it with limited resources?
- Can you do it while explaining each step?

## Calibration

Challenges should be calibrated to your current level:

**Too easy:** You complete it without learning anything. Increase difficulty.

**Too hard:** You fail completely with no useful insight. Decrease difficulty or break into smaller challenges.

**Just right:** You struggle, maybe partially succeed, and learn something concrete.

Calibration is itself a skill. You'll get better at it.

---

## Frequency

Generate challenges when:

- Your backlog is empty
- You've been coasting
- You want to deliberately grow in a specific direction

Don't overdo it. Challenges require energy. Balance challenge with consolidation.

## The Growth Edge

```text
Comfort Zone ──── Edge ──── Impossible
       ↑            ↑             ↑
   Too easy     Growth      Too hard
                happens
                 here
```

Stay at the edge. That's where you become more than you were.

*Challenge yourself. Grow deliberately.*
