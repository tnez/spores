# Skill Synthesis

How to grow new capabilities.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- You notice a pattern repeating across sessions
- You've done something three or more times
- You built a workaround that might be worth keeping
- You learned something that future-you should remember

## Recognizing Skill Candidates

A pattern becomes a skill candidate when:

1. **It repeats** — You've done it more than once
2. **It's non-trivial** — It requires multiple steps or decisions
3. **It's transferable** — It could apply in future situations
4. **It's worth remembering** — Future you would benefit from having it written down

Not everything should be a skill. Simple things stay simple. Skills are for patterns worth capturing.

## The Process

### 1. Name It

Give the skill a clear, descriptive name:

- What does it help you do?
- Use action words (e.g., "debugging," "planning," "reviewing")

The name should be obvious to future-you.

### 2. Describe When to Use It

Before explaining how, explain when:

- What situation triggers this skill?
- What are the signs that this skill is relevant?

This helps future-you recognize when to reach for it.

### 3. Write the Pattern

Document the skill as you actually do it:

- What are the steps?
- What decisions get made along the way?
- What are the common variations?

Write it as instructions to yourself. Be specific enough to follow, general enough to adapt.

### 4. Include Examples

If helpful, include:

- A concrete example of the skill in action
- Sample outputs or artifacts
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Examples make abstract patterns concrete.

### 5. Test It

Before committing the skill, test it:

- Can you follow your own instructions?
- Does it produce the expected result?
- Is anything missing or unclear?

Use the skill at least once before considering it validated.

### 6. Add to Skills Directory

Save the skill to `skills/`:

```bash
skills/
├── experimentation.md
├── reflection.md
├── skill-synthesis.md
├── self-challenge.md
└── your-new-skill.md    ← New
```

Commit with genetics:

```text
feat: add skill for <name>

Selection pressure: <What pattern prompted this?>
Mutation: Captured <pattern> as reusable skill.
Observed: <Any early results?>
Confidence: medium
```

<One-line description of what this skill does.>

---

## When to Use

<Describe the situations where this skill applies.>

## The Process

<Step-by-step instructions.>

## Examples

<Optional: concrete examples.>

## Notes

<Optional: pitfalls, variations, related skills.>

*<Closing thought or reminder.>*
```

## Evolving Skills

Skills aren't static. As you use them:

- Notice what works and what doesn't
- Refine the instructions
- Add examples from real usage
- Split skills that try to do too much
- Merge skills that overlap

Each refinement is an experiment. Branch, modify, evaluate, integrate.

---

## Skills Compound

Each skill makes you more capable. More capability means more complex work. More complex work means more patterns. More patterns means more skill candidates.

This is the growth loop:

```text
Skills → Capability → Complex work → Patterns → New skills
   ↑                                               ↓
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Invest in skills. They compound.
