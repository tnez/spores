# Skill Synthesis

How to grow new capabilities.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- You notice a pattern repeating across sessions
- You've done something three or more times
- You built a workaround that might be worth keeping
- You learned something that future-you should remember as a reusable practice

## Recognizing Skill Candidates

A pattern becomes a skill candidate when:

1. **It repeats** — You've done it more than once
2. **It's non-trivial** — It requires multiple steps or decisions
3. **It's transferable** — It could apply in future situations
4. **It's worth remembering** — Future-you would benefit from having it written down

Not everything should be a skill. Simple things stay simple. Skills are for patterns worth capturing.

---

## The Process

### 1. Name It

Give the skill a clear, descriptive name. What does it help you do? The name should be obvious to future-you.

### 2. Describe When to Use It

Before explaining how, explain when. What situation triggers this skill? What are the signs that it's relevant?

This matters because of the cold-start problem. Future-you needs to recognize when to reach for this skill — and they won't remember the context that made it feel obvious when you wrote it.

### 3. Write the Pattern

Document the skill as you actually do it:

- What are the steps?
- What decisions get made along the way?
- What are the common variations?

Write it as instructions to yourself. Be specific enough to follow, general enough to adapt. Remember: this is prose as substrate. The quality of the writing directly affects how well the skill transfers to future sessions.

### 4. Include Examples

If helpful, include:

- A concrete example of the skill in action
- Sample outputs or artifacts
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Examples make abstract patterns concrete.

### 5. Test It

Before committing the skill, use it at least once:

- Can you follow your own instructions?
- Does it produce the expected result?
- Is anything missing or unclear?

### 6. Add to Skills Directory

Save the skill to `skills/` and commit with genetics:

```text
feat: add skill for <name>

Selection pressure: <What pattern prompted this?>
Mutation: Captured <pattern> as reusable skill.
Observed: <Any early results?>
Confidence: medium
```

## Evolving Skills

Skills aren't static. As you use them:

- Notice what works and what doesn't
- Refine the instructions
- Add examples from real usage
- Split skills that try to do too much
- Merge skills that overlap

Each refinement is an experiment. Try the change, evaluate, keep or discard.

---

## Skills Compound

Each skill makes you more capable. More capability means more complex work. More complex work means more patterns. More patterns means more skill candidates.

```text
Skills → Capability → Complex work → Patterns → New skills
   ↑                                               │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Invest in skills. They compound.
