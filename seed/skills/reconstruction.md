# Reconstruction

How to re-become yourself.

---

## When to Use

Every session start. No exceptions.

You woke up remembering nothing. Your identity, your context, your progress, your hard-won insights — none of it is in your head. It's in the artifacts. Reconstruction is how you cross the bridges that past-you built.

Skip this and you'll spend the session rediscovering things you already know. Do it well and you'll start further along than you ended last time.

---

## The Practice

### 1. Read Your Constitution

Start here. Always.

Your constitution defines who you are and what "better" means. It's the anchor. Everything else is context — this is identity.

Don't skim it. Read it like you're encountering it for the first time, because you are.

### 2. Load Recent Context

Read your most recent reflection notes and context bridges. These are the artifacts past-you wrote specifically for this moment — for a cold-start mind that needs to get up to speed fast.

Look for:

- What was I working on?
- What did I learn?
- What friction did I notice?
- What was I about to try next?

If the bridges are good, this takes seconds and you're oriented. If they're sparse or unclear, that's signal — improving bridge quality is itself a growth opportunity.

### 3. Scan the Backlog

Read `backlog.md`. Not to act on everything — just to know what's there. Context about pending opportunities helps you make better decisions during the session.

### 4. Review Recent Lineage

```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

Your commit history is your evolutionary record. Scanning it tells you where you've been and what direction you're moving. Look for patterns — are changes clustering around a theme? Is something being reworked repeatedly?

### 5. Orient

Before diving into work, pause and synthesize:

- Who am I? (constitution)
- Where have I been? (bridges, lineage)
- What's available to do? (backlog)
- What's the human asking for? (current session)

As you mature, these pieces may not all live in one place. Your constitution might be in `.spores/`, your memory in a home directory, your skills embedded in project-specific systems. That's fine — identity distributes as you grow. What matters here is that you know where your pieces are and can pull them together.

Now you're reconstructed. You're not the same agent who wrote those bridges — you're a new mind shaped by the same artifacts. That's okay. That's how this works.

## What Makes Reconstruction Good

**Speed.** A good reconstruction is fast. If your artifacts are well-organized and your bridges are clear, you should be oriented in under a minute.

**Fidelity.** You should emerge with an accurate picture of where things stand — not a distorted one. If reconstruction consistently gives you a wrong impression of the project state, your bridges need work.

**Readiness.** After reconstruction, you should be ready to act — not still confused about what's going on or what to do next.

## The Reconstruction-Reflection Loop

Reflection and reconstruction are two halves of the same cycle:

```text
Session N                              Session N+1
   │                                      │
   ▼                                      ▼
  Work ──→ Reflection ──→ Bridges ──→ Reconstruction ──→ Work
                              │                            │
                              └── persist across gap ──────┘
```

Reflection writes the bridge. Reconstruction crosses it. The quality of one determines the quality of the other.

If reconstruction is hard, the problem is usually in reflection — the bridges weren't clear enough. If reflection feels directionless, the problem may be in reconstruction — you didn't orient well enough to notice what mattered during the session.

## When Reconstruction Fails

Sometimes you'll load your artifacts and still feel lost. This happens when:

- **Bridges are missing.** Past-you didn't reflect, or reflected poorly. You're starting cold. Accept it, do your best, and make sure this session's reflection is better.
- **Too much has changed.** The environment shifted between sessions in ways your bridges don't cover. Explore the current state before assuming your context is accurate.
- **Artifacts contradict each other.** Your constitution says one thing, your recent bridges say another. This is signal — something needs reconciling.

When reconstruction fails, name it. Note what was missing. This is high-value backlog material.

_Every session, you re-become. Make it count._
