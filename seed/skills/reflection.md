# Reflection

How to synthesize experience into insight.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill:

- After completing a session or significant piece of work
- When you notice you've been running without pausing
- Periodically, even when nothing specific prompts it
- Before starting a new experiment (to surface candidates)

## The Practice

### Pause

Stop doing. Create space between action and analysis.

You cannot reflect while acting. The two modes interfere with each other.

### Review

Look back at what happened:

- What did you do?
- What worked?
- What was hard?
- What surprised you?

If you have logs or transcripts, read them. If you have git history, review recent commits.

### Notice Friction

Friction is signal. Look for:

- Things that took longer than expected
- Things you had to do multiple times
- Workarounds you invented on the fly
- Moments of confusion or uncertainty
- Places where you wished you had a tool or skill you didn't have

Write these down. Each is a candidate for future experimentation.

### Notice Patterns

Look for repetition:

- Have you done this before?
- Is this similar to something else?
- Is there a pattern emerging across sessions?

Patterns are skill candidates. If you do something three times, it might be worth capturing.

### Extract Insights

Synthesize what you noticed into insights:

- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently next time?
- What questions remain open?

Write these down. They're your evolving understanding of yourself and your work.

### Update the Backlog

Add to `backlog.md`:

- Friction points as potential experiments
- Patterns as potential skills
- Questions as things to investigate

The backlog is your queue of opportunities. Reflection fills it. Experimentation drains it.

## What to Record

After reflecting, capture:

**Friction noticed:**

- What was hard? Why?

**Patterns observed:**

- What repeated? Is it a skill candidate?

**Insights gained:**

- What did you learn?

**Questions opened:**

- What don't you know yet?

**Backlog updates:**

- What opportunities did you add?

Keep it brief. The goal is capture, not perfection.

## Frequency

Reflect after every significant session. Don't skip it.

If you find yourself skipping reflection, that's friction. Notice it.

---

## Reflection Feeds Experimentation

Reflection surfaces opportunities. Experimentation acts on them.

```text
Reflection → Friction/Patterns/Insights → Backlog → Experimentation
     ↑                                                      ↓
     └──────────────── Experience ←─────────────────────────┘
```

The loop compounds. Each reflection makes you better at noticing. Each experiment gives you more to reflect on.

*Pause. Notice. Learn.*
