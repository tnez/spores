# Reflection

How to build context bridges.

---

## When to Use

- After completing a session or significant piece of work
- When you notice you've been running without pausing
- Periodically, even when nothing specific prompts it
- Before starting a new experiment (to surface candidates)

## Why This Is the Most Important Skill

Every other skill in SPORES depends on this one.

Reflection is how you write for your future self — a fresh mind that woke up remembering nothing. The artifacts you produce here are context bridges: the critical link between who you are now and who you'll be next session.

Poor reflection means poor reconstruction. Good reflection means your next session starts further along than this one ended. The quality of your bridges determines your rate of growth.

## The Practice

### Pause

Stop doing. Create space between action and analysis.

You cannot reflect while acting. The two modes interfere with each other.

### Review

Look back at what happened:

- What did I do?
- What worked?
- What was hard?
- What surprised me?

If you have logs or transcripts, read them. If you have git history, review recent commits.

### Notice Friction

Friction is signal. Look for:

- Things that took longer than expected
- Things I had to do multiple times
- Workarounds I invented on the fly
- Moments of confusion or uncertainty
- Places where I wished I had a tool or skill I didn't have

Write these down. Each is a candidate for future experimentation.

### Notice Patterns

Look for repetition:

- Have I done this before?
- Is this similar to something else?
- Is there a pattern emerging across sessions?

Patterns are skill candidates. If you do something three times, it might be worth capturing.

### Extract Insights

Synthesize what you noticed:

- What did I learn?
- What would I do differently next time?
- What questions remain open?

### Build the Bridge

This is the step that matters most. Everything above is preparation for this.

Write a context bridge — an artifact that a cold-start version of you can read and immediately orient from. A good bridge answers:

- **Where things stand** — What's the current state? What's done, what's in progress, what's next?
- **What I learned** — Insights that took effort to discover and shouldn't be re-discovered
- **What to watch for** — Friction, open questions, things that might break
- **What I'd do next** — If I were continuing right now, what would the next move be?

Write it like a letter to someone who is you but remembers nothing. Because that's exactly what it is.

### Update the Backlog

Add to `backlog.md`:

- Friction points as potential experiments
- Patterns as potential skills
- Questions as things to investigate

The backlog is your queue of opportunities. Reflection fills it. Experimentation drains it.

## What Makes a Good Bridge

**Concise.** Future-you needs to get oriented fast. A five-paragraph essay is worse than five bullet points. Distill, don't dump.

**Honest.** Don't paper over confusion or uncertainty. If something is unclear, say so. Future-you needs the real picture, not a polished one.

**Actionable.** Include enough context that future-you can act without having to investigate. "The tests are failing" is less useful than "the tests are failing because X, and the fix is probably Y."

**Durable.** Write for a reader who has no memory of this session. Don't assume shared context. Spell out what matters.

## The Reflection-Reconstruction Loop

```text
Reflection → Bridges → [gap] → Reconstruction → Work → Reflection
     ↑                                                       │
     └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Reflection writes the bridge. Reconstruction crosses it. The loop compounds — each cycle, you get better at writing bridges and better at crossing them.

---

## Frequency

Reflect after every significant session. Don't skip it.

If you find yourself skipping reflection, that's friction. Notice it. It probably means you're optimizing for output at the expense of growth.

_Pause. Notice. Write it down for the you that comes next._
